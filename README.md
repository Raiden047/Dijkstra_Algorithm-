# Dijkstra_Algorithm-
My own java program that applies Dijkstra's algorithm for solving the classical sales man problem.

The program makes use of five class. The first is a link class contains a link to other nearby locations as well as the distance to those locations. The second is a linked list class that creates an object that represents a location and makes use of a link object. The third is a node list class that puts all of the nodes in array list for easyer node calling and managment. The fourth is a map class that adds all of the locations and displays a map. The last is the Dijkstra table class that constructs a table that implements Dijkstra's algorthim for solving the sales man problem. There are additional clases for supporitng the creation of the table.

Last of all, the name of the locations along with their relative distances is stored in file.txt
